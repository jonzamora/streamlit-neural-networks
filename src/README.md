# Streamlit Apps

## Structure

I am developing a **Neural Network Layer Calculator**. Learn more about it (and its status) in the `neural-net-layer-calculator` directory!

I also have some example Streamlit apps which are from the [Main Concepts](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals/main-concepts) page of the Streamlit documentation. These apps are in the `examples` directory, and serve as a starting point for using Streamlit to build interactive Machine Learning and Data Science web applications.

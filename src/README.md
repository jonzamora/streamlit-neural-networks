# Streamlit Apps

## Structure

Currently, I have some Streamlit apps which are from the [Main Concepts](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals/main-concepts) page of the Streamlit documentation. These apps are in the `examples` directory, and serve as a starting point for using Streamlit to build interactive Machine Learning and Data Science web applications.

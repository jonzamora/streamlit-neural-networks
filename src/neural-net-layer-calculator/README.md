# Neural Net Layer Calculator

## Motivation

Creating Neural Network architectures can be a daunting task for many people. 

Perhaps you are like me, and you have found yourself wanting a simple, accessible tool for calculating the input and output shapes of neural network layers, with the output of the calculator resembling a PyTorch-style chunk of code grouping your layers together.

I've started this project with the broad goal of making this tool for my personal development and understanding of neural networks. Perhaps in the end, the tool won't be that useful or interesting, but I am hopeful that it will help me.

I hope it helps you too.
